ATT will have an AI-driven singleplayer, as well as multiplayer allowing you to create parties, host/join servers, and will also include a state of the art Annoyance Prevention System (APS) allowing you to mute/ghost/vote-kick players who are not so board game inclined.",

I will be engaging daily with the community on our Discord and making changes to the game based on consensus. We'll also be having brainstorming sessions for features that would be great to see in the game, the most upvoted idea for that session will be implemented and showcased in DevLogs!",
